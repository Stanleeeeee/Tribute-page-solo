        <p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.

          Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large
           variations in temperature between day and night
           put strains on the rocks, which consequently break
            in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts,
             there are occasional downpours that can result in
             flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause
             them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and
             rubble strewn over the desert floor are further
             eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of
             sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended
             periods  sometimes causing the formation of sand
             storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking
              any solid object in their path can abrade the surface.
               Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into
                uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets
                of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes.
                Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the
                fine material has been blown away and the surface
                consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas
                are known as desert pavements, and little further
                erosion takes place. Other desert features include
                rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited
                by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt
                pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be
                underground sources of water, in the form of springs
                and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found,
                oases can occur.</p>
